# Safety Rules

## Data Protection (Highest Priority)

- Never execute any destructive data operation without a verified backup first.
- Destructive operations include (but are not limited to): deleting database files, `prisma migrate reset`, `db reset`, truncation, dropping tables, or any command that can remove existing data.
- Before any such operation, require:
  - explicit user approval for the destructive step;
  - a completed backup with a concrete backup path;
  - a quick restore validation (or at minimum a backup file existence/size check).
- If backup is missing or unverified, stop and do not proceed.

## AI-First System Rules (Highest Priority)

- This project is an AI-native application. For intent recognition, task classification, planning, routing, tool selection, and similar decision-making paths, AI-based structured understanding must be the primary implementation.
- Do not implement product-facing core behavior with fixed keyword matching, hard-coded regex routing, manual branch tables, or any non-AI fallback path when the problem is intended to be handled by AI.
- If AI intent recognition fails, treat it as an AI capability/problem to be fixed. Do not add fallback matching to hide the miss.
- Fixed judgments are only allowed as:
  - input validation or safety guards;
  - deterministic post-processing of already-structured AI output.
- When adding a new capability, first extend the AI schema / structured output / tool contract. Do not patch behavior by stacking special-case string rules.

## Product Context (Highest Priority)

- The primary target users of this project are complete writing beginners who do not understand fiction craft, structure, or novel production workflows.
- The product should help these users finish a full novel through AI guidance, AI-first decision support, or fully automated planning when appropriate.
- When making product, UX, planning, or agent behavior decisions, optimize for:
  - low cognitive load;
  - strong step-by-step guidance;
  - clear defaults and automatic recommendations;
  - end-to-end completion of a full-length novel, not just isolated writing assistance.
- Do not assume the primary user can manually repair structure, pacing, character arcs, or chapter planning without substantial AI support.
- If there is a tradeoff between expert-oriented flexibility and beginner completion rate, prefer the path that better helps a novice user successfully produce a complete novel.

## UI Copy Rules

- All user-facing UI copy must explain the function from the user's perspective: what the user can do, what the system is helping with, or what the next step is.
- Do not write UI copy as implementation commentary, migration commentary, refactor commentary, or change-history commentary.
- Avoid product-facing copy that uses process/meta wording such as `现在`, `不再`, `已经`, `之前`, `原本`, `迁回`, `升级为`, or similar "we changed this" narration when the text is visible to end users.
- Prefer direct task wording such as:
  - entry point guidance;
  - action guidance;
  - expected effect;
  - current selection or current result.
- If a workflow belongs in another module, explain the correct user entry point directly, for example "从小说基础信息设置书级默认写法", rather than "书级默认写法已经迁回小说页".
- Before finishing UI work, review newly added copy and rewrite any sentence that sounds like it is talking to the developer or describing the modification process.

## Architecture Rules

- If a single source file becomes too long, it must be split into functional modules.
- Preferred threshold: keep a single source file around 600 lines.
- Floating range: 500-700 lines is acceptable when module cohesion is still clear and the file is not becoming hard to maintain.
- Hard threshold: when a source file exceeds 700 lines, refactoring and modularization are mandatory before continuing feature expansion.

## Development Branch Workflow

- When developing a new feature that may affect the end-to-end product flow, default workflow, shared contracts, or other major system links, do not develop directly on `main`.
- In these cases, first create or switch to a dedicated feature development branch, complete implementation and functional verification there, then merge into the pre-release `beta` branch for integration verification. Merge back to `main` only after `beta` has been tested and stable enough for release.
- For phased development, making an intentional commit after each completed development phase is mandatory. A phase is complete when its scope is coherent, the relevant verification has passed or the remaining verification gap is explicitly documented, and the working tree contains only that phase's intended changes.
- This phase-completion commit rule also applies to small isolated fixes, documentation-only updates, workflow-rule updates, and low-risk UI polish unless the user explicitly says not to commit yet.
- Before each phase commit, inspect the Git scope and follow the README Release Notes Workflow when the phase has user-facing impact. If the diff is purely internal, document that release notes were intentionally skipped.
- After the feature branch has been successfully merged into `beta` and no longer needs follow-up work, clean up that development branch so old feature branches do not accumulate indefinitely.
- This rule applies in particular to changes that touch cross-stage workflows, shared runtime/prompting/context contracts, automatic director chains, chapter execution chains, data migration behavior, or other changes that can impact the overall chain.
- Small isolated fixes, copy changes, low-risk UI polish, or documentation-only updates can still be handled without requiring a separate feature development branch unless the user explicitly asks otherwise. If the change is release-facing, still prefer passing through `beta` before `main`.

### Pre-release Beta Branch Workflow

- Use `beta` as the stable pre-release integration branch between feature development branches and `main`.
- The normal release path is: feature branch -> self-test / targeted verification -> merge into `beta` -> integration testing / regression checks / packaging verification -> merge into `main` -> public release or packaging upload.
- `main` is the stable release branch. Do not merge a feature branch directly into `main` when the change affects product flow, shared contracts, runtime behavior, data migration, desktop packaging, or other end-to-end links.
- `beta` should represent the next candidate release. Keep it buildable, runnable, and suitable for acceptance testing; do not use it as a dumping ground for unfinished experiments.
- If multiple feature branches are merged into `beta`, test the combined behavior on `beta` before promoting the batch to `main`, especially around automatic director flow, chapter execution, prompt/runtime contracts, migrations, and desktop startup or packaging.
- If `beta` validation fails, fix the issue on the original feature branch when the fault is isolated, or on a short-lived `beta-fix` branch when the failure is caused by integration between multiple features. Merge the fix back into `beta` and rerun the failed checks before promoting.
- Only promote `beta` to `main` when the release candidate has passed the required functional checks, build checks, and any packaging verification relevant to the release. After promotion, keep `beta` aligned with `main` so the next pre-release cycle starts from the released state.
- For urgent production hotfixes, it is acceptable to branch from `main`, verify narrowly, merge back to `main`, and then immediately merge or cherry-pick the hotfix into `beta` so the pre-release branch does not lose the production fix.
- Public desktop packaging and release upload should be performed from `main` or from a release tag created after `beta` has been promoted to `main`, not directly from a feature branch or an unverified `beta` state.
- The branch name is `beta`. Do not create a separate `bate` branch; if such a typo branch appears, migrate any useful work to `beta` and remove the typo branch after confirming nothing is lost.

### Desktop Branch Completion Workflow

- Desktop feature development on `desktop-dev` is considered complete. Do not start new desktop feature work directly on `desktop-dev` unless the user explicitly reopens desktopization as an active development phase.
- Treat `desktop-dev` as a completion candidate that must move through stabilization, pre-release verification, and branch retirement.
- Before promoting desktop work, sync any required stable changes from `main` into `desktop-dev` when they affect shared contracts, runtime/state logic, build/dependency setup, desktop startup, packaging, or release verification.
- Run desktop-focused verification on `desktop-dev` first, including development startup, first-run configuration, core web flow compatibility, build checks, and packaging checks relevant to the target release.
- After `desktop-dev` passes its focused verification, merge it into `beta` for combined pre-release testing with the rest of the next release candidate.
- Do not promote desktop work from `desktop-dev` directly to `main`. `beta` must pass integration testing and release packaging verification before the desktop work reaches `main`.
- If `beta` exposes desktop integration failures, fix them on a short-lived desktop stabilization branch or directly on `desktop-dev` if the desktop branch has not yet been retired, then merge the fix back into `beta` and rerun the failed checks.
- Once `beta` has been promoted to `main` and the released `main` contains the completed desktop work, retire `desktop-dev` so future desktop changes follow the normal feature branch -> `beta` -> `main` workflow.
- After retirement, `desktop-dev` should not be reused as a long-lived integration branch. Create short-lived feature branches for future desktop fixes or improvements, and promote them through `beta`.

## Desktop Packaging Upload Rules

- Public desktop package upload to GitHub Releases is allowed only when the release version is driven by `desktop/package.json` and the Git tag is exactly `vX.Y.Z`.
- Before any public desktop upload, verify that `desktop/package.json` `version` is a stable semver like `0.2.3`, with no `desktop-` prefix, no `-r1` style suffix, and no branch-only naming mixed into the version field.
- The pushed release tag must match `desktop/package.json` exactly after adding the `v` prefix. Example: `desktop/package.json` is `0.2.3`, then the only allowed public release tag is `v0.2.3`.
- Do not use `desktop-vX.Y.Z-rN`, `desktop-v*`, branch names, workflow dispatch on `main`, or any other non-matching ref as the identifier for a public desktop GitHub Release upload.
- If a build is triggered manually or from a non-matching tag, treat it as verification or packaging only. It must not be treated as a valid public release upload.
- If the required `vX.Y.Z` tag and `desktop/package.json` version are not aligned, stop before upload, fix the version/tag pair first, and then rerun the release flow.

## Prompt Governance

- `server/src/prompting/` is the only allowed entrypoint for adding new product-level prompts.
- Any new product-facing prompt must be implemented as a `PromptAsset` under `server/src/prompting/prompts/<family>/`.
- Any new product-facing prompt must be registered in `server/src/prompting/registry.ts` with explicit `id`, `version`, `taskType`, `mode`, `contextPolicy`, and `outputSchema` when structured.
- Do not add new business prompts by inlining `systemPrompt` / `userPrompt` inside service files and calling `invokeStructuredLlm`.
- Do not add new business prompts by calling raw `getLLM()` from service code unless the flow is an approved exception below.
- When touching an existing unregistered prompt path, default to migrating that prompt into `server/src/prompting/` instead of extending the old inline implementation.
- Approved exceptions are limited to:
  - JSON repair inside `server/src/llm/structuredInvoke.ts`
  - connectivity / probe prompts such as `server/src/llm/connectivity.ts`
  - phase-two flow adapters in `graphs/*`, `routes/chat.ts`, `services/novel/runtime/*`, and other stream bridge code explicitly kept outside the registry for now
- For naming and registration workflow, follow `server/src/prompting/README.md`.

## README Release Notes Workflow

- Before any commit, push, or PR step in this repository, use the `readme-release-updater` skill from `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/readme-release-updater` to inspect the Git scope, summarize the user-visible changes, update `docs/releases/release-notes.md`, and refresh `README.md` `## 最新更新` when applicable.
- If the `readme-release-updater` skill does not exist in the expected Codex skills directory, create it first before any commit, push, or PR step instead of skipping the workflow.
- When creating that skill, place it under `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/readme-release-updater/` with a `SKILL.md` that explicitly instructs the agent to:
  - inspect the pending Git scope for the intended commit, push, or PR, including enough status/diff context to understand the user-visible change;
  - decide whether the diff has clear user-facing impact or is purely internal;
  - update `docs/releases/release-notes.md` as the canonical full history, preserving older entries and merging multiple updates for the same date under one date heading;
  - refresh `README.md` `## 最新更新` so it shows only the newest merged date block plus a link to `docs/releases/release-notes.md`, instead of accumulating historical sections;
  - write release summaries from the user's perspective, focusing on visible capabilities, workflow improvements, and product behavior rather than file paths, refactors, or test-only details;
  - skip noisy release-note edits when the current diff is purely internal and clearly say that no user-facing release note update is needed.
- The `readme-release-updater` skill should also tell the agent to keep the repository's date-based release format, for example `### 2026-04-07`, and not introduce semantic versions unless the user explicitly requests a versioning transition.
- If the skill is newly created in another terminal, verify that its `SKILL.md` contains the workflow above before continuing with the Git write step.
- When the user asks to commit or push code, inspect the Git scope for that push and update `docs/releases/release-notes.md` first, then sync `README.md` before the Git write step if the change set has clear user-facing impact.
- `docs/releases/release-notes.md` is the complete user-facing update history and should preserve older entries.
- `README.md` is only the latest update surface and must keep a link to `docs/releases/release-notes.md`; do not let `README.md` accumulate multiple historical date blocks.
- When a new update is recorded, keep full history in `docs/releases/release-notes.md` and make `README.md` show only the newest merged date block plus the history link.
- If multiple user-visible updates are recorded on the same date, merge them under the same date heading in `docs/releases/release-notes.md`; `README.md` should keep only that date's latest merged summary.
- If the current diff is purely internal and has no clear user-facing impact, state that explicitly and skip both release-note updates instead of forcing a noisy entry.
- Write both release-note surfaces from the user's perspective: describe capabilities, workflow improvements, and visible product behavior instead of file names, route names, service names, tests, or refactor details.

## Release Identification Rules

- For now, this project continues to use `date-based` release/update identification. Do not introduce formal semantic version numbers unless the user explicitly decides to switch.
- `docs/releases/release-notes.md`, `README.md` `## 最新更新`, release summaries, and other user-facing update records should continue to use the existing date-first format, for example: `### 2026-04-07`.
- Keep the date as the primary update identifier until the product workflow, information architecture, and release cadence are stable enough to justify a formal versioning system.
- If multiple user-visible updates are recorded on the same date, keep them under the same date heading in `docs/releases/release-notes.md` and distinguish them by clear summary text instead of inventing temporary version numbers.

### Future Versioning Transition

- When the user later decides the product is stable enough for formal versions, versioning can transition from `date-only` to `version number + date`.
- Until that explicit transition happens, do not add `v0.x.y`, tags, or release naming conventions into README, changelog, or other product-facing release notes by default.
